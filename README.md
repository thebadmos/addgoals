# addgoals
AddGoals is a React Native project representing my initial foray into mobile app development. Drawing from various online tutorials and YouTube resources, 
I synthesized my learnings to craft this application.

Overview
AddGoals serves as a simple to-do list, allowing users to input their weekly goals. As of now, the project primarily employs React Native along with CSS for styling. 
Notably, it hasn't integrated any external APIs.

Features
Goal Addition: Users can seamlessly add their goals for the week.
React Native Implementation: Leveraging React Native for cross-platform functionality.
CSS Styling: Utilizes CSS for a visually appealing user interface.

Future Enhancements
While the current version is API-free, future iterations aim to incorporate external APIs for expanded functionality and data management.
